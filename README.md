# Website for "Health for Future Dresden"
This is the github repository for the [quarto](https://quarto.org/)-based website of the Health for Future Group Dresden, a group belonging to the [Friday for Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_Strike_for_Climate) movement.

Currently, the website is still under construction.

The site is deployed via netlify [here](https://h4f-dresden.netlify.app/). Once it is fit for publication it will hopefully be published at the corresponding subdomain of Health for Future Germany ([Link](http://dresden.healthforfuture.de/)).

Feel free to give feedback and contact me if you want to fork this site (should not be a problem).
